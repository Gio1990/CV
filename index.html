        <p><em> Former Hooper Turned Below Average Gamer <strong><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/chefgordonramsay1990">Below Average Gamer</a></strong>.</em></p>
        <p> Body falling apart from years of running on a basketball court, I decided to stop playing and move into a career in Tech. I've spent the last 6 years of my professional career in Technical Recruting and Software Sales but have recently made the decision to persue a career in programming. I've become driven to build products and applications from the ground up, and aspire to one day to build my own video game company.  </p></td>
